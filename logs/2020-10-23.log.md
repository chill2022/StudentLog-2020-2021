- [x] Figure out how to make a tag using git
- [x] Try to finish milestone one

Signing off, I forgot to sign off last night but i put the time that I think I did. I think I have the milestone one project complete besides the tag.
I am waiting to do it just incase i realize I forgot to do something. I am also going to commit my work now that I finished last night.
(I am writting the sing off on the 24th at 1:32Pm but i finished the work at around 10pm on the 23rd)
