Signing on, I dont have any wifi right now so it may be hard to git push any thing but I am going to work on
the title and making the hover colors work.

- [x] Work on milestone 1

Signing off, I still have no wifi but I have finished the beach resort logo and have done the menu with the hover effects. I think I have id's attached to the menu but I guess I will find out later in the project. I am not sure
if I have to add the large image under the menu with the sand dollar under the beach. Again I will try and git push 
my work as soon as I can but It may just all come at once.
